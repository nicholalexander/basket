# Contributing to Basket

This is a small project.  We welcome ideas, contributions, thoughts, issues, bug reports, questions and any other thing you might like to add.  

If you do want to add something, open and issue and we will respond!  Our current list of issues is sort of short hand between to the two authors, but we'd be happy to clarify anything if you are so interested.

We use `standardrb` for linting.
We use `rspec`.

If this is your first contribution to any open source project, we'd be happy to help you get something merged!  If you have an idea or question and are new to Ruby, we would love to help you!
